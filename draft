# ⚡ UK Electricity Demand Forecasting App

An interactive demand forecasting app built to simulate the real-time pressures of short-term electricity trading. Designed for traders, grid operators, and system forecasters, it supports intraday decision-making around imbalance risk, flexible dispatch timing, and peak load management.

## 🔍 Overview

This app forecasts UK electricity demand up to 24 hours ahead using weather and time-based features. It allows users to simulate real-world trading scenarios such as delayed reforecasting, peak stress periods, and dispatch planning around system constraints.

The tool was developed to mirror the decision pressure and uncertainty faced in short-term power trading environments — and is inspired by the kind of work done by Octopus Energy Trading.

## 📈 Features

- Real-time forecast vs. actual demand visualisation
- Toggle between **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, and **Linear Regression** models
- Recursive forecasting to simulate real-time updates over a rolling horizon
- Stress-testing for operational edge cases (e.g. cold weather spikes, lag drift)
- Forecast error threshold flagging to simulate imbalance cost risk
- Peak load detection with suggested flexible dispatch timing
- GPT-powered narrative summaries to support fast situational awareness

---

## 🧠 Trading Relevance

This tool mimics key workflows in short-term power trading:

- **Forecast error impacts**: Understand how over/under-forecasting drives imbalance cost exposure
- **Dispatch timing**: Identify when flexible assets should respond to price or demand signals
- **Reforecasting logic**: Simulate how strategy shifts with updated information
- **Stress-testing**: Evaluate how forecasts behave under operational stress scenarios

---

## 📊 Key Results

- **XGBoost** consistently outperformed other models under volatile conditions (e.g. holiday weekends or simulated cold snaps)
- Recursive reforecasting improved MAE by up to 15% vs. static forecasts on high-volatility days
- GPT summary generation provided fast narrative insight for traders evaluating risk windows

## 🧪 Models Used

Three forecast models are available in the app:

- **XGBoost Regressor**: Optimised for tabular performance, best in tests
- **Random Forest**: Robust ensemble baseline
- **Linear Regression**: Simple, interpretable benchmark

**Engineered features include:**
- Hour of day, day of week, weekend flag
- Lagged demand (t-24h, t-168h)
- Public holiday flags
- Hourly temperature
- Peak hour indicator

## 🛠 Future Development

- Live data ingestion from National Grid ESO (API-based)
- Overlay of STOD price curves for flex value simulation
- Asset-specific dispatch modelling (e.g. batteries, CHP)
- Cost-weighted imbalance exposure estimates
- Market-driven decision simulation for flexible portfolios

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Streamlit
- Open-Meteo API, UK Gov API
- GPT (via OpenAI integration)

## 🧠 Author Notes

This project was developed as part of my pivot into the trading space, with a focus on applying machine learning, real-time simulation, and energy market concepts in a way that mirrors operational desk decision-making.

Built to learn — and to share.
